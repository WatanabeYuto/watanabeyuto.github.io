Yuto Watanabe/渡邊優大

I was born in TOYOTA city, Aichi, Japan, on October 16 1999.

I received the Bachelor's degree in Mechanical engineering and Master's degree in Informatics both from Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan, in 2022 and in 2024, respectively.
I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Kazunori Sakurama](http://www.ids.sys.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/sakurama/index_e.html) and [Prof. Toshiyuki Ohtsuka](http://www.ids.sys.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~ohtsuka/index.htm).
From April 2024 to August 2024, I was a research fellow at Kyoto University funded by the JSPS Research Fellowship for Young Scientist DC1.

From September 2024, I am a Ph.D. student at the ECE department, University of California San Diego, USA.
I work at the Scalable Optimization and Control (SOC) Lab under the supervision of [Prof. Yang Zheng](https://zhengy09.github.io/index.html).

My research interests include control theory, optimization, and their applications to network systems (e.g., distributed algorithms).
I was awarded the 2024 Funai Overseas Scholarship.

In my free time, I enjoy running, juggling, and listening to music.
