Yuto Watanabe/渡邊優大

### Bio
I am a Ph.D. student at the ECE department, University of California San Diego, USA.
I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yang Zheng](https://zhengy09.github.io/index.html).
Previously, I obtained the bachelor's and master's degrees from Kyoto University, where I was working with [Prof. Kazunori Sakurama](http://www.ids.sys.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/sakurama/index_e.html) and [Prof. Toshiyuki Ohtsuka](http://www.ids.sys.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~ohtsuka/index.htm).
I was awarded the 2024 Funai Overseas Scholarship.
My research interests include control theory, convex and nonconvex optimization, and  their underlying duality.

In my free time, I enjoy running, juggling, and listening to music.

- 2025 December: A talk on [Semidefinite Programming Duality in Infinite-Horizon Linear Quadratic Differential Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02201) at **IEEE CDC 2025** at Rio, Brazil. [[Slides]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CCRbqFxUcOWdvHNvNHR6t9i49bbmdrLn/view?usp=sharing)

- 2025 November: My two previous papers at Kyoto Univ finally got accepted to **IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control**. I express my deepest thanks to my former advisor, Prof. Sakurama. [[URL]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11264282)  [[URL]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11239461)

<!-- - 2025 October: A talk on [nonsmooth nonconvex H-infinity optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25633) at the Southern California Workshop at UC Irvine. [[Slides]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H37gwgLJTSR2myNdTQ50rq6brpeEkW02/view?usp=sharing) -->

<!-- 
- 2025 March: Check out [our new preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10964) on **a revisit of LQR**! This is my first work at UCSD! In this work, we show **strong duality** of the LQR policy optimization problem, despite the nonconvexity, and provide a more generalized analysis for the **gradient dominance**. We also provide an SDP and duality-based proof for deriving the analytic solution to LQR! (Also check out [this slide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yij6Shnm9-aObMxfb68spP4ocih-qUfD/view?usp=sharing)!) -->
