### Bio
I am a Ph.D. student at the ECE department, University of California San Diego, USA.
I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yang Zheng](https://zhengy09.github.io/index.html).
Previously, I obtained the bachelor's and master's degrees from Kyoto University, where I was working with [Prof. Kazunori Sakurama](http://www.ids.sys.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/sakurama/index_e.html) and [Prof. Toshiyuki Ohtsuka](http://www.ids.sys.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~ohtsuka/index.htm).
I was awarded the 2024 Funai Overseas Scholarship.
My research interests include control theory, optimization, and  their underlying duality.

In my free time, I enjoy running, juggling, and listening to music.

### Research updates

- 2025 April: Check out [our new preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02201) on a **primal-dual perspective** for LQ differential games and H infinity control! In this work, we present a new proof for solving them from a semidefinite programming and duality perspective.

- 2025 March: Check out [our new preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10964) on **a revisit of LQR**! This is my first work at UCSD! In this work, we show **strong duality** of the LQR policy optimization problem, despite the nonconvexity, and provide a more generalized analysis for the **gradient dominance**. We also provide an SDP and duality-based proof for deriving the analytic solution to LQR! (Also check out [this slide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yij6Shnm9-aObMxfb68spP4ocih-qUfD/view?usp=sharing)!)

### Unimportant personal updates

- 2025 May: I finished the La Jolla half marathon with the time [1:39:24](https://runsignup.com/Race/Results/116383#resultSetId-550895;page:2;perpage:100)!
